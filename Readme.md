🚀 Cryptocurrency Market Prediction with Risk Intelligence

A deep learning–based cryptocurrency forecasting system designed to predict short-term price movements and evaluate market risk using real-time trading data and technical indicators.

📌 Overview
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and nonlinear, making accurate prediction challenging. This project implements advanced deep learning models such as **LSTM, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Hybrid architectures** to capture temporal dependencies and improve prediction reliability. The system also includes a **Risk Intelligence Engine** that detects volatility spikes and abnormal market behavior to generate actionable **BUY / SELL / WARNING alerts**.

🔑 Features

- Real-time cryptocurrency price prediction
- Technical indicator extraction (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, Volume, Volatility)
- Hybrid LSTM + TCN deep learning architecture
- Market risk classification (Low / Medium / High)
- Automated trading alerts
- Visualization dashboard for trend and prediction monitoring

🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas & NumPy
- Plotly / Matplotlib
- Binance & CoinGecko API
